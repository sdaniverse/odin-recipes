    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat the stock</strong> - In a separate large saucepan, heat your chicken stock to a simmer then
            reduce to the lowest heat just to keep it very hot without boiling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook aromatics</strong> - in a heavy pot or dutch oven over medium-low heat, add butter and oil, and
            sautee onions with salt, stirring with a spatula until softened (do not brown the onions). Add garlic and
            stir for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast rice</strong> - add rice, increase to medium heat, and stir for about 3 minutes until the rice
            is toasted and starting to look translucent.</li>
        <li><strong>Add white whine</strong> - stir in the white wine and continue stirring for 2 minutes or until
            mostly evaporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Add stock</strong> - using a ladle, add one ladle-full at a time and continue stirring until
            absorbed before adding another ladle-full. Continue this process until the rice reaches your desired
            doneness. This takes 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-ins</strong> - add the remaining butter and parmesan cheese then season to taste with salt if
            needed and serve garnished with more cheese and freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
