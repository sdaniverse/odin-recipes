    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the pasta, put the flour in a bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the eggs and egg yolks and mix
            with a fork, bringing more of the flour in from the sides as you mix. Once the mixture comes together into a
            ball, tip it out onto a work surface and knead for 10-15 mins until firm and smooth. Wrap and leave to rest
            for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the garlic for 30
            seconds. Add the spinach with a few tablespoons of water, and cook until the spinach has wilted and is dark
            green and the water has evaporated. Stir in the lemon zest, grate over some nutmeg and season. Tip the
            mixture into a bowl and leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Cut the pasta dough into four pieces so it’s easier to work with. Run one piece through a pasta machine
            (leaving the remaining pieces covered to prevent them drying out), starting with the widest setting and
            working down to the thinnest setting. Keep the machine and the pasta well floured to prevent sticking or
            tearing.</li>
        <li>Mix the ricotta into the spinach mixture and season well. Do this just before you’re ready to fill the
            pasta, or chill until needed..</li>
        <li>To make the ravioli, cut a sheet of pasta in half so you have two equal lengths. Lay out on a well-floured
            work surface, then spoon heaped teaspoons of the filling, spaced 5cm apart, over one of the pasta sheets.
            Brush the exposed pasta around the filling with water. Gently lift the second pasta sheet over the fillings,
            and use the side of your hand to press the pasta sheets together around the fillings to seal, ensuring there
            are no air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Stamp out the ravioli using a round cutter (position it so the filling is in the centre of the circle), or
            use a sharp knife to cut out square ravioli. Arrange in a single layer over baking trays dusted with flour,
            then repeat the process with the remaining pasta dough pieces. Will keep, covered and chilled, for up to two
            days.</li>
        <li>To cook, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and gently lower in the ravioli using a slotted
            spoon. Boil for 2-3 mins until the pasta is cooked through, then remove to a bowl using a slotted spoon.
            (You may need to cook the ravioli in batches to ensure it's evenly cooked.)</li>
        <li>Heat the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, drop in the sage and fry until the butter
            turns a nutty brown and the sage leaves are crisp. Remove from the heat and toss in the ravioli. Sprinkle
            with parmesan and some lemon juice, then season with cracked black pepper and toss gently in the butter to
            coat. Divide between warm bowls and sprinkle with more parmesan before serving.</li>
