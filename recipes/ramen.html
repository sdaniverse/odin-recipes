    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Take your instant noodles to the next level with this Quick Homemade Ramen. In just about 20 minutes, you'll

        directly in it. Bright kale, shredded carrots, and
        scallions add freshness and texture. Top it off with crunchy panko crumbs, a soft boiled egg (optional), chili
        oil or sriracha, and sesame oil, and you've got a cozy, flavorful bowl ready to nourish and delight. Perfect for
        busy weeknights when you crave comfort with a clean, fresh twist.</p>
